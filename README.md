# University-Library-Management-System

The University Library Management System is a Java application designed to manage various types of items in a library, including books, journals, and movies. The system allows for the addition, borrowing, returning, rating, and searching of library items, providing an interactive console-based interface for users. This project demonstrates the application of core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and Java's collections framework to handle data management efficiently.

**Features**
- Item Management: Create and manage library items such as books, journals, and movies with detailed attributes.
- Search and Sort: Search for items by ID or title, and sort items by average rating and ID.
- Borrowing and Returning: Manage the borrowing and returning process, including tracking due dates.
- Rating System: Implement a rating system that calculates average ratings based on user inputs.

**Object Oriented Programming**
- Encapsulation: Utilizes getters and setters to protect the integrity of item data.
- Inheritance: Implements class hierarchies for different item types (Books, Journals, Movies), sharing common attributes and methods.
- Polymorphism: Uses method overriding to provide specific implementations for each item type.
